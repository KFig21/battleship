# Battleship

- Made for The Odin Project curriculum
- React based application

# Things I'm proud of:

- AI that seeks preferred targets when it gets adjacent hits
- The overall design aesthetic
- Using Hooks rather than variables to store/update information

# Things I need guidance with:

- How to implement tests with React applications. I keep running into errors that aren't involved with the tests, any help would be greatly appreciated!
- Cleaning up my code & components. I feel I implemented more hooks than necessary and that too much of my code is in the app component.
