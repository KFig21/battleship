# Battleship


- <a href="https://kfig21.github.io/battleship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View the project here!</a>
- Made for The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum
- React based application

<h3> Things I'm proud of: </h3>

- AI that seeks preferred targets when it gets adjacent hits
- The overall design aesthetic
- Using Hooks rather than variables to store/update information

<h3> Things I need guidance with: </h3>

- How to implement tests with React applications. I keep running into errors that aren't involved with the tests, any help would be greatly appreciated!
- Cleaning up my code & components. I feel I implemented more hooks than necessary and that too much of my code is in the app component.
